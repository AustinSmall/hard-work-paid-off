This project is a rough draft of my portfolio. Due to this there are a lot of place holders. I was not sure what a good biography would be for me so I was going to work with career services to figure that out. The About me section also is not formatted the way I want it to be just yet, I orignally wanted the picture and the text side by side but it was not working how I intended. For the my work section I did not want to include Run Buddt since it is not really my work. So, since I do no have any work of my own to display yet I have place holder images and text until I have the projects that we do in the bootcamp done.
